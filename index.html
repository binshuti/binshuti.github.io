        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>
            Our interactive soccer game, inspired by foosball, challenges players to navigate a ball past randomly moving defenders to score goals. With each goal, the game intensifies: the ball's speed increases, and more defenders join the fray. Designed for soccer enthusiasts and casual players alike, this game combines strategy, agility, and fun.
        </p>
        <p>
            Players use arrow keys to control the ball, moving it across the field with precision. Each level introduces a higher velocity, demanding quicker reflexes and smarter maneuvers. Our goal is to create a series of levels that not only increase in speed but also in difficulty, offering a competitive and engaging experience for all.
        </p>
        <p>
            We prioritize fair play and user privacy; no personal information is stored, ensuring a secure gaming environment. Our objective is to create an ethically responsible game that's as enjoyable to play as it is to master.
